          Known as a creative problem solver and passionate developer, with a focus on performance and ease of interfacing. My aim is to become an impactful and engaging part of a team that works to create user friendly experiences. I am currently working on a MERN stack movie trivia app that allows users to use a pre-existing catalog of categories or add their own as desired. The app will allow users to submit players and keep score as the game progresses. Comfortable with all stages of the development process from stylesheets to database management, Iâ€™m excited to leverage my skills as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team to build higher performing apps/software.
